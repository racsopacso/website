Notable Projects:
Evil Bit Messaging Protocol:
Using an unused bit in the IPv4 header, I was able to implement a linux kernel module to send information piggybacking on existing packets.

Cursed Mastermind: 
Algorithm that plays Mastermind against the player, cheating (undetectably) to maximise the length of time it takes for them to win.

Desktop Background Generator: 
Program that automatically generates desktop backgrounds on boot by combining images from a pool. 

Sliding DFT filter: 
Part of my Masters project. Generic frequency filter implemented on a development board in C. Uses an algorithm that can be faster than the standard FFT in the low-latency case.

Spectogram:
Part of my Masters project. Visually displays the frequency-domain representation of a signal. Computationally efficient enough that maximum detectable frequency is limited by board I/O rather than processing time.
