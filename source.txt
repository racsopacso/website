$ASCENDANT is an Ascendent of $WARREN, the third warren of the hells. $NOMINATIVE is a Guardian, one of the Eight who act to stop the Crippled God escaping. $NOMINATIVE is a symbol of horror, decay, the end of things that is not quite death. A giant worm, $NAME was the matriach of $GENITIVE hive, a queen amongst millions. $NOMINATIVE answered the call, as all others did, fighting the being they called Conqueror, who was bound to become the Crippled God. $NOMINATIVE tried taking over Warrens than $GENITIVE own, and got a few before they bound $ACCUSATIVE away.
