In the fading echoes of a world's distant past, there exists a god named Ascendant, the Dying Lord of Waters. Ascendant's presence is a melancholy reflection of the once-mighty force they once represented, a deity whose powers have waned as the waters of the world have receded.

Ascendant appears as a figure draped in tattered, seaweed-like robes that hang heavily, as if burdened by the weight of their diminishing dominion. Their skin, once vibrant and azure, has now paled, mirroring the fading rivers and dwindling lakes of the world. Ascendant's eyes are deep pools of sorrow, reflecting the regret and sadness that comes with the decline of their realm.

The god carries a staff that once wielded the power to shape seas and command waves, but now it is mere driftwood, a relic of past glory. In one hand, Ascendant holds a chalice, empty and dry, symbolizing the dwindling waters they once controlled. In the other, they bear a crumbling seashell, a reminder of the time when the oceans teemed with life.

Ascendant's divine realm, the Desolate Depths, is a place of desiccated riverbeds, cracked lakebeds, and endless, parched landscapes. Here, the god is attended by spectral water spirits and aquatic creatures that have become mere echoes of their former selves, their vitality drained by the god's fading power.

As the Dying Lord of Waters, Ascendant's role is to oversee the preservation and protection of the world's remaining water sources, as well as to mourn the loss of what once was. They are a patron of conservationists, healers, and those who strive to restore the world's waters to their former glory. Ascendant embodies the bittersweet realization that all things must pass, even the mightiest of natural forces.

Worshipers of Ascendant offer tribute in the form of efforts to conserve and restore water sources, acts of healing for the wounded world, or offerings of precious tears shed for the plight of the dying waters. In return, the god imparts wisdom about the importance of cherishing and protecting the natural world, as well as the strength to persevere in the face of inevitable change.

Ascendant is a deity of faded grandeur, a symbol of the fragility of the natural world and the need for responsible stewardship. In a fantastical world where the elements are both awe-inspiring and vulnerable, Ascendant stands as a solemn reminder that even gods can wither and fade, and that the balance of nature must always be carefully preserved.
